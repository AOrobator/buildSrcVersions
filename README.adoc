Gradle has a special module called **buildSrc** where you can put Kotlin code and make it directly available to all your Gradle build files.

This is better than the traditional solution of putting your global variables in a Gradle `ext` property or in a Groovy `HashMap`,
because in that case, the IDE support is exactly what you would expect when you work with an `HashMap`.

Now, what is better than writing manually those files link:doc/Versions.kt[`Versions.kt`] and link:doc/Libs.kt[`Libs.kt`]?

Having a Gradle plugin write them for you maybe?

== Prerequisites

- Kotlin, JVM and Android projects.
- Gradle 4.3+ and Gradle 5.0+
- The IDE integration works in IntelliJ >= 2008.03+ and Android Studio 3.2+.
- The IDE integration works for both `build.gradle` (Groovy) and `build.gradle.kts` (Kotlin) files.


== Installation

Edit your root `build.gradle(.kts)` file

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes]
----
buildscript {
    //...
}
plugins {
  id("de.fayard.buildSrcVersions") version "{plugin_version}"
}
// Don't put any code before the buildscripts {} and plugins {} block
----

== Extract your dependencies

The plugin adds a task to your build, also called `:buildSrcVersions`. Run it like this:

```bash
$ ./gradlew buildSrcVersions
> Task :dependencyUpdates
> Task :buildSrcVersions
        new file:   buildSrc/build.gradle.kts
        new file:   buildSrc/.gitignore
        new file:   buildSrc/settings.gradle.kts
        new file:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt
        new file:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Versions.kt
```

Synchronize your Gradle build and you can start to replace your magic strings:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(Libs.okio)
    implementation(Libs.com_squareup_moshi_moshi)
}
```


== Search for dependencies updates

Upgrade dependencies tend to be tedious but it is critically important.

Let say you stumble on a problem.
If you open an issue, you are likely to hear: "_Are you using the latest version_?".
If you look at the documentation, you may find often that it is contained in the README.
Often that means that only the latest version is correctly documented, not the one you are using!


This plugin inherits from https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin[Ben Manes's Versions plugin]
the feature to automatically determine which dependencies have updates.

When you decide you want to update some dependencies, run again the plugin:

```bash
$ ./gradlew buildSrcVersions
> Task :dependencyUpdates
> Task :buildSrcVersions
        modified:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Libs.kt
        modified:   buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Versions.kt

```

The file `Versions.kt` is regenerated with a comment indicating which new version is available.

```kotlin
object Versions {
    val moshi = "1.8.0"
    val com_squareup_okhttp3 = "3.11.0" // available: "3.12.0"
}
```

As shown in this screencast:

- To update, just delete the part `"3.11.0" // available` .
- Remove the comment if you don't want to update.


== FAQ

TODO.

https://gradle.org[Gradle] and https://jetbrains.com[JetBrains] have made this plugin possible
by working on improving the IDE support for Kotlin code from the `buildSrc` module.

This plugin embraces and extends https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin[Ben Manes's wonderful "Versions" plugin].
